# GBGNRNet
This repo contains the KERAS implementation of "Gradient and Multi Scale Feature Inspired Deep Blind Gaussian Denoiser"

# Run Experiments

To test for blind gray denoising using GBGNRNet write:

python Test_gray.py

The resultant images will be stored in 'Result/'

Image wise PSNR & SSIM as well as Average PSNR & Average SSIM for the whole image database is also displayed in the console as output.
